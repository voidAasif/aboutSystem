# aboutSystem

aboutSystem is a simple desktop application built using Java Swing, AWT, and the Java system libraries. It retrieves and displays detailed system specifications such as the OS name, OS version, processor information, memory, GPU, and more. The application provides an easy way to view essential system details through a graphical interface.

## Features

- Display Operating System information (name, version, architecture).
- Show processor details.
- Retrieve GPU information.
- Memory details including RAM and storage.
- Battery status and display configuration.
  
## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 8 or above**: Ensure that you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **Swing and AWT Libraries**: These come pre-packaged with the JDK, so no external libraries are required.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone or Download** the project from the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/voidAasif/aboutSystem.git

            ```bash
            javac aboutSystem.java
            jar cf aboutSystem.jar aboutSystem.class
            ```
        2. Then, run the JAR file:
            ```bash
            java -jar aboutSystem.jar
            ```
